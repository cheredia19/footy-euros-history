The victory of Spain over England by 2-1 closes another fascinating chapter of the UEFA European Competitions. It represents the fourth championship for the Spaniards, overtaking Germany as the most winning team in the Euro's history. France and Italy complete the list of countries with more than one European championship, while other seven nations have won it once each.

West Germany played until Euro 1988 when they hosted the competition. Since the [German reunification](https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany/The-reunification-of-Germany), they began playing as Germany in Sweden (1992).

As a single nation, Germany has participated uninterruptedly since 1972 (Belgium). Germans won 28 of 58 games played (a winning rate of 48.3%).

## A glimpse of the seventeen UEFA Euro competitions

The first UEFA Euro Championship was held for the first time in France, from June 7 to June 10, 1960. There were only four teams (Czechoslovakia, France, Yugoslavia, and the USSR). Four matches were played: two semifinals, the game for the third place, and the final. The USSR defeated Yugoslavia in aggregated extra time by 2-1, making them the first-ever European champions.

The semifinal-third place match-final format continued until 1976 when Euro was held in the extint Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia won their first and only Euro, defeating West Germany on penalties with a [game-winning penalty from Antonin Panenka](https://youtu.be/ROG4-QPIDgo?feature=shared&t=101) that made history by creating a new style of kicking penalties, imitated by the likes of Francesco Totti, Zinedine Zidane, and Andrea Pirlo, among others.
