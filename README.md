The victory of Spain over England by 2-1 closes another fascinating chapter of the UEFA European Competitions. It represents the fourth championship for the Spaniards, overtaking Germany as the most winning team in the Euro's history. France and Italy complete the list of countries with more than one European championship, while other seven nations have won it once each.

As a single nation, Germany has participated uninterruptedly since 1972 (Belgium). Germans won 28 of 58 games played (a winning rate of 48.3%).
